  <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/0/0e/Dwayne_McDuffie.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150519210931"><img class="mcDuffie-head-shot img-responsive" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/0/0e/Dwayne_McDuffie.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150519210931" width="350px" height="500px"></a>
  
<p class="text-center start">For more than one generation of fans, McDuffie will always be beloved for his work as Executive Producer and head writer of Justice League Unlimited, the animated series that so perfectly expressed the action, humor and spirit of the DC Universe. Through the show, McDuffie is responsible for endearing viewers to the DC superheroes and to the genre in general, including many minorities and women, whom the writer always depicted with boldness and grace.
<br>
As a television writer, story editor and producer for animated series, he had credits on "What's New, Scooby-Doo?," "Teen Titans," "Static Shock," "Justice League," "Ben 10: Alien Force" and "Ben 10: Ultimate Alien." He also wrote the screenplay for "All-Star Superman," an animated film released Tuesday by Warner Home Video, and the second of three he wrote for the series, "DC Universe Animated Original Movies."

McDuffie launched his career in 1987 as a special comics editor for Marvel Comics.

At Marvel, he wrote for Spider-Man and other major characters and co-created the limited series Damage Control, about a firm that repairs the property damage caused by battles between superheroes and super-villains.<br>

In 1992, two years after leaving Marvel to freelance full time as a comic book writer, McDuffie co-founded Milestone Media, whose comic books were distributed by DC Comics.
  
  In 1993, Milestone Media launched its first batch of titles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_(comics)"><a href="">Hardware</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(comics)">Icon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Syndicate">Blood Syndicate</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)">Static</a>. At the same time, SkyBox and DC issued a trading card series, Milestone: The Dakota Universe.<br>

A year later, Milestone Media published its first company-wide crossover, Shadow War, which spawned two more titles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_(comics)">Shadow Cabinet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xombi">Xombi</a>. Another ongoing series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobalt">Kobalt</a>, was introduced later. Milestone also participated in an intercompany crossover with DC, called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_Collide_(comics)">Worlds Collide</a>" in which Metropolis-based superheroes from the DC Universe and Dakota-based superheroes from the Dakotaverse interacted temporarily.
  
  <br><br>

When he was a child in Detroit, McDuffie recalled in a 1996 interview with the Detroit Free Press, "there were only two comic strips that had black leading characters. When we got together to form our company, there were still only two — 20 years later. We felt there should be more diversity."

In addition to celebrating diversity, the Free Press reported that McDuffie also wanted to subtly teach important lessons and values, as well as having his characters confront the kind of problems faced by his readers.
